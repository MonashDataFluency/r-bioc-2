"Since you all have different backgrounds, some of this may be things you know. I'm hoping there will also be plenty of parts that are new. Bioconductor has many useful features that are hard to discover, and one of the points of this workshop is to show how to discover these. There may also be things I go through too quickly, please ask a question if I do that."
