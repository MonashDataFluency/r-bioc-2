For the rendered workshop material, go to:

* https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-bioc-2/

The files in the directory docs/ can be rendered from the rmarkdown documents in markdown/ from the command line using 

```
make
```

You will need to have installed Python 3, R, and the R packages needed for the workshop.

Tested on Mac OS. Should also work on Linux. All the actual R code in the workshop should also work on Windows.
